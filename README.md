### Decorators in Action  
Function decorators are the mechanism for adding some extra functionality for functions. A function can “decorate” another function.  

Class decorators are the mechanism for adding some extra functionality and the state for functions. A class can “decorate” a function.

### How to run
Open a directory on your local system and run the following commands  
1. ```git clone git@github.com:Ozziekins/Software_Design_with_Python.git```  
2. ```cd Software_Design_with_Python```  
3. ```python3 ./src/main.py```  

You can replace the decorators denoted by `@decorator1` with `decorator2`, `ClassFuncDecorator` or `ClassFuncDecorator2` depending on the task you want to check out. All tasks can be seen in the [Assignment file](https://github.com/Ozziekins/Software_Design_with_Python/blob/main/SSD%20Assignment%201.md)  

> **_NOTE:_** For task 3 and 4 where files are generated, the files will be created in the root directory called _Software_Design_with_Python_
